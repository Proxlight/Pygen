## Formatting Your Figma Design

### 1. Reference
**Naming is Important**
| Figma Element Name | Tkinter Element  |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Button              | Button           |
| Line                | Line             |
| Text                | Name it anything  |
| Rectangle           | Rectangle        |
| TextArea            | Text Area        |
| TextBox             | Entry            |

The code generated by PyGen is based on the names of elements from your Figma design, so you need to name your elements accordingly. In Figma, rename your elements by double-clicking them in the Layers panel.

### 2. Element Guide
**First, create a Frame that will serve as your Tkinter Window.**

- **Adding Images**: 
  - Use shapes and/or images. If you use multiple shapes/images, group them together (CTRL/⌘ + G) and name the group "Image".

- **Text**: 
  - Use the text tool to add text. No need to rename it for PyGen.

- **Entry (Single-Line User Input)**:
  - Use the Rectangle tool to create an Entry and name it "TextBox".

- **Text Area (Multi-Line User Input)**:
  - Create a Rectangle and name it "TextArea".

- **Normal Button**:
  - Create a rectangle for the button and name the group "Button" (include text if desired).
